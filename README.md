# Modular-Update-TACC

This repository hosts code, experimental results, and CI logs related to a modular update framework for large foundation models, designed for deployment on shared cyberinfrastructure platforms such as TACC. The framework focuses on platform-aware adaptation, resource-efficient retraining, and belief-driven model refinement.

Current contents include early-stage implementations of selective adaptation, uncertainty-guided evaluation, and human-in-the-loop belief correction, as well as preliminary TACC job logs and system interaction scripts.
